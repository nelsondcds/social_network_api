# social_network_api by Nelson Carlos Da Silva

This repository contains my submission for the NoSQL Challenge: Social Network API. The challenge consists of building an API for a social network web application where users can share their thoughts, react to friendsâ€™ thoughts, and create a friend list. Requirements included using Express.js for routing, a MongoDB database, and the Mongoose ODM.
